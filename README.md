## TIY Durham Rail Lecture Pictures
This app is for TAs in the Iron Yard Durham Ruby/Rails class to upload lecture pictures for the instructor to post on the course website.  I know...this could just be done in a number of different (probably easier) ways, but I just wanted to make a rails app, because coding is neat!
